# Data Exploration and Linear Regression Model Training Python Script

This Python script is designed for exploring a dataset and training a linear regression model on housing prices data. It leverages the pandas library for data manipulation, matplotlib for data visualization, and scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the required libraries installed before running the script:

pandas (pandas)
numpy (numpy)
matplotlib (matplotlib)
scikit-learn (scikit-learn)

# Description

The script begins by importing necessary packages, including pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
It reads a housing prices dataset from a specified URL using pandas.
Various exploratory data analysis (EDA) tasks are performed, such as checking data types, printing dataset shape, and exploring column names.
Descriptive statistics are generated using the describe() function to summarize each column.
Visualizations include histograms and scatter plots to explore the distribution of the target variable (SalePrice) and relationships with other features.
Missing values are examined, and columns with missing values are identified.
A linear regression model is trained using scikit-learn, and predictions are compared with actual values through visualizations and mean squared error calculations.
